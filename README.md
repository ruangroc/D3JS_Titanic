# D3JS_Titanic
DIV Lab starter project - create a visualization interface for Titanic decision tree data

1. Create a table to display the nodes in a decision tree (annotated version attached below), created using the Titanic dataset that was run through a prediction model.
2. Create a table to display all passengers / instances in the dataset.
3. Run the data through the sklearn t-SNE algorithm and plot it as an svg using d3js.
4. Add interation: clicking on a row in the nodes table should filter the data shown in the instances table and highlight the instances in the tsne plot.
